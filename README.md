# Running Instructions

# Project Brief

<p>Build an app that allows a user to track their spending.</p>

<h3>MVP</h3>
<ul>
<li>The app should allow the user to create, edit and delete merchants, e.g. Tesco, Amazon, ScotRail</li>
<li>The app should allow the user to create, edit and delete tags for their spending, e.g. groceries, entertainment, transport</li>
<li>The user should be able to assign tags and merchants to a transaction, as well as an amount spent on each transaction.</li>
<li>The app should display all the transactions a user has made in a single view, with each transactionâ€™s amount, merchant and tag, and a total for all transactions.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Inspired by:</h3>
<p>Monzo, MoneyDashboard, lots of mobile/online banking apps</p>
<h3>Possible Extensions</h3>
<ul>
<li>Transactions should have a timestamp, and the user should be able to view transactions sorted by the time they took place.</li>
<li>The user should be able to supply a budget, and the app should alert the user somehow when when they are nearing this budget or have gone over it.</li>
<li>The user should be able to filter their view of transactions, for example, to view all transactions in a given month, or view all spending on groceries.</li>
</ul>
